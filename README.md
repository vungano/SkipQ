# SkipQ
Skip Q is a mobile app that enables users to do their shopping without going through the till point. The idea behind the app is that a user should just be able to enter a store and 
connect to the store's wifi, scan and pay for items in app. The app uses Google ML's barcode scanning api for scanning the barcodes.
